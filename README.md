## I'm no longer maintaining this codebase. Sorry :/

Sublime Text 3 plugin which allows users to send and receive text messages. (Android Only)

## I Don't Want My Contacts Stored In The Cloud!

We don't want your contacts either!

The only information sent to the SubTexting server is:

1.  Contact name and
2.  The "local ID" of the contact. Plus they are only stored temporarily!

### "Local ID" of the contact?

Well! Let us explain!

We don't want to be sending the number of your contacts around! So instead, we just pass the id of a contact.

That id is stored only on your device! Say you have a contact whose name is "John Smith" with the phone number: 123-456-7890. When you first saved that contact, your phone stored it with an id. Say the id is `234`. Now, when you upload your contact so it can be accessed be the SubTexting, we won't be sending John's number. Instead, we'll reference his id. In addition to that, the SubTexting server will store that information temporarily!

Once you fetch that information down using the plugin, that information is deleted from our servers!
